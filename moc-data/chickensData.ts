The Rhode Island Red chicken was recognized by the American Poultry Association in 1904 for the single comb then again in 1906 for the rose comb, and serves as the official Rhode Island state bird.",

      "The Silkie (also known as the Silky or Chinese silk chicken) is a breed of chicken named for its atypically fluffy plumage, which is said to feel like silk and satin. The breed has several other unusual qualities, such as black skin and bones, blue earlobes, and five toes on each foot, whereas most chickens only have four. They are often exhibited in poultry shows, and also appear in various colors. In addition to their distinctive physical characteristics, Silkies are well known for their calm, friendly temperament. It is among the most docile of poultry. Hens are also exceptionally broody, and care for young well. Although they are fair layers themselves, laying only about three eggs a week, they are commonly used to hatch eggs from other breeds and bird species due to their broody nature.",

      "The Silkie (also known as the Silky or Chinese silk chicken) is a breed of chicken named for its atypically fluffy plumage, which is said to feel like silk and satin. The breed has several other unusual qualities, such as black skin and bones, blue earlobes, and five toes on each foot, whereas most chickens only have four. They are often exhibited in poultry shows, and also appear in various colors. In addition to their distinctive physical characteristics, Silkies are well known for their calm, friendly temperament. It is among the most docile of poultry. Hens are also exceptionally broody, and care for young well. Although they are fair layers themselves, laying only about three eggs a week, they are commonly used to hatch eggs from other breeds and bird species due to their broody nature.",
    origin:
      "As you might guess, the Rhode Island Red origin is the East Coast in Massachusetts and Rhode Island. Rhode Island Red chickens are as American as baseball, but were developed by breeding the Malay, a lanky Asiatic bird thought to hail from northern Pakistan, and the Cochin, from Shanghai, with the Java and brown Leghorn chicken breeds. Most Rhode Island Red chickens have single combs, but many have rose combs due to a recessive gene in the Malay ancestry. The Rhode Island Red chicken was recognized by the American Poultry Association in 1904 for the single comb then again in 1906 for the rose comb, and serves as the official Rhode Island state bird.",

The vaccine is modified and requires only half of the dosage compared to the previous products due to its high concentration.",

      "The Silkie (also known as the Silky or Chinese silk chicken) is a breed of chicken named for its atypically fluffy plumage, which is said to feel like silk and satin. The breed has several other unusual qualities, such as black skin and bones, blue earlobes, and five toes on each foot, whereas most chickens only have four. They are often exhibited in poultry shows, and also appear in various colors. In addition to their distinctive physical characteristics, Silkies are well known for their calm, friendly temperament. It is among the most docile of poultry. Hens are also exceptionally broody, and care for young well. Although they are fair layers themselves, laying only about three eggs a week, they are commonly used to hatch eggs from other breeds and bird species due to their broody nature.",
    origin:
      "As you might guess, the Rhode Island Red origin is the East Coast in Massachusetts and Rhode Island. Rhode Island Red chickens are as American as baseball, but were developed by breeding the Malay, a lanky Asiatic bird thought to hail from northern Pakistan, and the Cochin, from Shanghai, with the Java and brown Leghorn chicken breeds. Most Rhode Island Red chickens have single combs, but many have rose combs due to a recessive gene in the Malay ancestry. The Rhode Island Red chicken was recognized by the American Poultry Association in 1904 for the single comb then again in 1906 for the rose comb, and serves as the official Rhode Island state bird.",

The appearance of the vaccine is milky white suspension, with a transparent upper portion before shaken that easily becomes homogenized once shaken.   The vaccine is modified and requires only half of the dosage compared to the previous products due to its high concentration.",

      "The Silkie (also known as the Silky or Chinese silk chicken) is a breed of chicken named for its atypically fluffy plumage, which is said to feel like silk and satin. The breed has several other unusual qualities, such as black skin and bones, blue earlobes, and five toes on each foot, whereas most chickens only have four. They are often exhibited in poultry shows, and also appear in various colors. In addition to their distinctive physical characteristics, Silkies are well known for their calm, friendly temperament. It is among the most docile of poultry. Hens are also exceptionally broody, and care for young well. Although they are fair layers themselves, laying only about three eggs a week, they are commonly used to hatch eggs from other breeds and bird species due to their broody nature.",
    origin:
      "As you might guess, the Rhode Island Red origin is the East Coast in Massachusetts and Rhode Island. Rhode Island Red chickens are as American as baseball, but were developed by breeding the Malay, a lanky Asiatic bird thought to hail from northern Pakistan, and the Cochin, from Shanghai, with the Java and brown Leghorn chicken breeds. Most Rhode Island Red chickens have single combs, but many have rose combs due to a recessive gene in the Malay ancestry. The Rhode Island Red chicken was recognized by the American Poultry Association in 1904 for the single comb then again in 1906 for the rose comb, and serves as the official Rhode Island state bird.",
